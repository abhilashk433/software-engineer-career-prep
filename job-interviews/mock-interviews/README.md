Open this [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1t_228bDllazltWrq7WrLaKCs3dHXlGHBybWz9nnRvSc/edit#gid=2041017957) and you will get a randomly-generated set of questions. Click on “File > Download as > PDF Document” to download the list of questions to a safe place. You will use this list as as guidance to interview your coding partner. You will need to be the “expert” in the room, so spend a maximum of 2 hour preparing the answers to those questions yourself. You can use Google to find for the optimal solution/answer to each question (especially to coding questions) so that you can guide your coding partner until he finds that same solution too.
