# Daily Schedule

Now that you are ready to start interviewing, you should focus on job applications while you continue improving your interviewing skills. In your free time, you should work on freelance, open source, and side projects to continue getting experience and improving your portfolio.

Here is a suggested schedule starting today:

8am - 9am / Technical interview prep: continue working on the Leetcode challenges and feel free to redo those challenges where you feel like you need some extra work. The more interviews you do, the more you will know what your weaknesses are.

9am - 10:00am / Apply to jobs: you should aim to apply to at least 3-5 jobs every day. If there are good opportunities in your dream list, start there. Otherwise, follow the “brute force” approach and use AngelList and other platforms to apply to other jobs.

10:00am - 10:30am / Twitter strategy: You can move this to another time of the day if you want, but remember to dedicate 30 minutes every day to look at your Twitter list and engage with people from your dream companies.

10:30am - 12:30pm / Mock Interviews & Projects: You should reserve some time for mock interviews and use the rest of the time to work on open source and side projects. Here is a suggested weekly schedule:

- Mondays: Mock Interview Prep
- Tuesdays: Mock Interviews
- Wednesday - Friday: Open Source, and Side projects

12pm - 1pm / Lunch break: Remember to always find time to eat well, sleep well, exercise and socialize. Working hard on your professional side shouldn’t mean that you have to neglect the other important parts of your life.

1pm - 5pm / Open Source, and Side projects: You will be using your afternoons to work on open source, and side projects. It’s very important to keep your real-world skills fresh while you keep getting experience and improving your portfolio.

5pm - 10pm / Networking (Optional): Some days, you will go to networking events and conferences in your city or participate in online hackathons. Otherwise, use this time to rest and take care of the other important things in your life.

Due to the different interviews that you will go through, you will often have to be flexible with this schedule. However, try to stick to it as much as possible so you keep making progress in a balanced way. If this schedule is not working for you, please reach out to your mentor and discuss it with them.
